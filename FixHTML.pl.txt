# FixHTML.pl -- a program to re-name files (*.htm->*.html) and
#               to make all files lower case.  I use this
#               as a converter from DOS to my UNIX WebServer.
#               Note: there are usually ^M's at then end of
#               each line in DOS.html files.  They are harmless.
