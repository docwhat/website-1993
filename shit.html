<P align=center>In the beginning was THE PLAN<BR>
And then came THE ASSUMPTIONS<BR>
And THE ASSUMPTIONS where without form<BR>
And THE DARKNESS was upon the face of THE WORKERS<BR>
And they spoke amongst themselves, saying<BR>
"It is a crock of shit, and it stinketh"<BR>
And THE WORKERS went unto their SUPERVISORS and sayeth<BR>
"It is a pail of dung and none may abide the odor thereof"<BR>
And THE SUPERVISORS went unto their MANAGERS and sayeth unto them,<BR>
"It is a container of excrement and it is very strong,<BR>
Such that none may abide by it"<BR>
And THE MANAGERS went unto their DIRECTORS and sayeth<BR>
"It is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its strength"<BR>
And THE DIRECTORS spoke amongst themselves, saying one to another,<BR>
"It conatins that which aids plant growth, and it is very strong"<BR>
And THE DIRECTORS went unto THE VICE PRESIDENTS and sayeth unto them,<BR>
"It promotes growth and is very powerful"<BR>
And THE VICE PRESIDENTS went unto THE PRESIDENT and sayeth unto HIM,<BR>
"This NEW PLAN will actively promote the growth and efficiency<BR>
of THIS COMPANY, and these areas in particular",<BR>
And THE PRESIDENT looked upon THE PLAN,<BR>
And saw that it was good, and the plan became policy.</P>
