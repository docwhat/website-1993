<H1 align=center>Programming!</h1>

<p>For some reason, I like programming!</p>

<p>When I was about eight years old, my parents brought home an
Apple ][+.  I thought it was awsome.  I learned AppleSoft Basic
pretty quickly, surpasing the knowledge of any of the adults
I had access to.</p>
<p>I started to use the manuals that came with it to learn to
program.  I wrote quiet a few programs, including things like
Mad Libs, a few cheesey games, and a drawing program.  I used
the drawing program to draw a TARDIS (a device from Doctor Who,
which looked like an ordinary Police Box from London).</p>
<p>I was very proud of that program because it worked well and
it actually saved the files in the correct binary format and
had a little trick that I could use the Koala Pad (a primitive
drawing tablet) and the keyboard simultaneously to allow great
control over the drawings.   I've only seen this feature in
deluxe paint and to a limited degree,

<p>Since I went to a private school where they didn't have or even allow
computers, I didn't get much chance to do much programming from ages
12 to 17 or so.  The school did decide that I could have a lap top, so
I got one and installed
<A HREF="http://www.borland.com/">Borland</a>
<A HREF="http://www.borland.com/Product/Lang/Cpp/Cpp.html">C++</a> on it.
</p>
<p>I had some fun with Borland, but I never made any great programs.  I wrote
a filter designed to pull out binary crap from text files called <em>gefilte</em>.
I also wrote many programs that were just to see if I could do something, like
an interactive menu.</p>
<p>Once I got to college, though, I discovered Linux.  I installed Linux on my
system with version 0.95, I believe.  I've had it on my computer ever since
(except after I tried an early Beta of Windows NT, which ran chkdsk on my
Linux partition and <em>fixed</em> all the errors).</p>
<p>After a while in Linux, I discovered a language called
<A HREF="http://www.ee.pdx.edu/~rseymour/perl/">perl</a>.  I really
like this language.  It's easy to program in and I think it's the coolest
language on the planet.</p>

<A NAME="HTML"><H2>HTML is programming?</h2></a>
<p>Well, it is and it isn't.  There aren't loops and such, but it is a
language, and you can get pretty complicated.  Since I started re-writing
my web page, I has both found and written several small perl programs to
help me maintain my Web pages.</p>
<p>I keep a copy of my pages on my machine at home.  This way, as I
debug them, they load fast.  I use both
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">Netscape</a> and
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</a>
at home, since what may work on one may not on the other.</p>
<p>I managed to find a perl script called
<A HREF="http://www.khoros.unm.edu/staff/neilb/weblint.html">WebLint</a>.
So, I went at found my self a copy of
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ee.umanitoba.ca/pub/msdos/perl/">perl for dos</a>.
I discovered that the path names needed to be changed in the WebLint script,
but it only took a little while to change.</p>
<p>Once I realized I had perl on my machine I started to really play with things.
The first thing I did was write a
<A HREF="http://www.students.uiuc.edu/~docwhat/mktoc.pl">Table of Contents/Indexer</a> for my WebPages.  I
wrote it so that it should work under DOS and UNIX (though I haven't tried UNIX,
yet). I'll warn you, I don't make any garauntees, but it <em>should</em> work
okay.</p>
<p>As I wrote this script, I decided to make this a package of tools to help
people, mainly me.  This and a few other scripts are part of my collection
I'm calling <em>Christian H&ouml;ltje's <a HREF="mtools.html">Magic HTML
Tools</a></em>.</p>
