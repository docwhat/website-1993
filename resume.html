<H2>Objective</H2>
<p>My objective is to find a job in computer science that is both fun and challenging.  I plan on writing my operating system that incorporates a better object oriented design than current operating systems as well as a user interface that works with the user.  I believe that a better graphic design as well as a more protective kernel would make for an operating system that will leave the current ones behind.</p>
