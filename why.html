<A NAME="Why Am I">Why Am I</a>
</h1>

Deep philosophical questions, I'll have to think about this one.<p>
The following is a list of the ideas I have come up with.  I am by <em>no</em> means finished.
<DL>
<DT>Mommy and Daddy got together....
<DD>If this needs explination, you are either
<UL>
<LI>a) Too Young
<LI>b) A CS Major
<LI>c) All of the above
</ul>
<p>

<DT>To Annoy Everyone on the planet, especially Dave Swallow.
<DD><p>Alright, so I don't know Dave Swallow, but he allegidly finds me annoying.
Dave, if this is so, mail me and tell me why!  After all, if you like Frank Herbert,
you can't be <em>too</em> bad.</p>
<p><em>Addendium:</em> I talked to Dave Swallow on the phone once.  He said he didn't know me,
so some one has been impersonating Dave and saying they don't like me. </p>

<DT><p>I was placed on this planet to sow chaos by Eris herself.</p>
<DD><p>Hail Eris!  All Hail Discordia!  <em>See previous entry.</em></p>

<DT><p>I'm going to write some of the most usable and well written code on the planet.</p>
<DD><p><em>See previous entry.</em></p>


<DT><p>To write an <em>awsome</em> Car Wars like game.</p>
<DD><p>I wrote Steve Jackson himself, but he said he needed proof I could write one, first.
So I thought I'd get a friend or two together, figure out the physics and write a better
game.</p>
<p>One of the first things I thought I'd fix was the 100 mph to 0 in 1/10th of a second
without the assistance of a brick wall.  Then I was going to work on the multi-G turns....</p>
