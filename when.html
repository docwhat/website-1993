<HR>
Currently, I exist in all time periods from December 14th, 1972 1:00 am to December 13th, 2052.
Except for about 2 hours on July 5th, 1994.<p>
It is possible that I exist past 2052, however, due to 
problems reading the chronostream that far ahead is difficult.
<p>
Before 1972, I have existed at least 3 times, however, I am unable to reveal details about these situations,
as it would compromise national security and probably warp your mind so badly that I would be
obliged to get a large hammer and bang it back into shape.
