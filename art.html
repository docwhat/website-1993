<H2>What I do and Why</H2>

<P>One of the things I've been doing since I was a little child, is drawing.
I'm not very good at, but people keep telling me I am. Since they keep saying
I'm good, I'm going to keep on drawing. It makes perfect sense, eh?</P>

<P>Over the years I have discovered that computers were a really cool medium
for creating art. Way back in the early eighties, I was drawing pictures on
my Apple ][+, using a program I wrote. I think it's very impressive that a
10 year old can draw a picture of a TARDIS (see <EM>Doctor Who</EM> in your
local video store) using homemade software.</P>

<P>About the time I discovered the Internet, I discovered that there was
raytracing and other photorealistic methods for creating pictures with the
computer. Naturally I wanted to get into this too. Unfortunately, I didn't
get a ray tracer till 1992, when I found POV-Ray on the net. I already had
<A HREF="linux.html">Linux</A> on my computer and boy did I like it.</P>

<P>Alas, POV-Ray isn't the easiest way to create three-dimensional images.
Eventually, I discovered that the UofI has an art lab with <EM>3D Studio</EM>
by Autodesk. This software is very slick, but hard to use. One day, I hope I
can afford the $2000 price tag.</P>

<P>Another form of art that I've been enjoying is digitalizing my hand drawn
art and then coloring and modifying it using <EM>Adobe Photoshop 3.0</EM>,
another piece of invaluable art software. This has had limited success, as
I scanning in the art and cleaning it up is difficult at times, but it's
usually fun, so I continue to do it.</P>

<P>Of late, my favorite computer based graphics programs have been: <em>Adobe Photoshop</em>,
<em>Fractal Design Painter</em>, <em>Paint Shop Pro</em>, and <em>Caligari TrueSpace</em>.
These pacakge are well designed and very powerful, though not necessarily easy to use.

<H2>What I have online</H2>
<HR>

<P>Obviously, I only have a small part of my artwork on line, as I have
limited space on networked machines. However, there are some examples and
here they are:</P>

<LI>My Dirty Pair Ray Trace file (400k, 8bit GIF) (circa 1992)<br>

This won't be up for a while, but you can try it.</P>
<P>I also have a 24bit version that is 2.5megs. It looks better, but it's large.
If you think I should upload it somewhere, then mail me and tell me so.  I
don't (currently) think there is any demand for it, but if I'm wrong, tell me!
Just mail me using the <em>docwhat@uiuc.edu</em> link at the bottom of any of
my homepages!</P>

<A HREF="dial9.jpg"><IMG SRC="dial9.gif" ALT="dial9.jpg" BORDER=0></a><br>
The history behind this is a little bizzare, but the idea is that I knew a guy
who had a telephone key pad on his jacket.  I asked him why he had a telephone key
pad on his jacket.  His reply, "Dial 9 to get out!"</P>
